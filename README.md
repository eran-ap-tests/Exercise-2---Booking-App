Hello,

This is my implementation for the booking app exercise.
It includes:

1. 4 Components: "App.jsx", "EmployeesList.jsx", "TopEmployees.jsx", "Hotel.jsx".

2. 2 service classes "employeesService.js" which helps with retrieving the top employees from the data and "dateService.js" which helps with working with the booking dates.

3. "apis_constants.js" which helps with retrieving the URLs for this assignment.

4. the scss files.

NOTE: I would invest in putting more comments throughout the code but the instructions to the assignment states that there is no need for comments.

Thanks, 
Eran
